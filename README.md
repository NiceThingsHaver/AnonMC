Brings the idea of being anonymous to Minecraft multiplayer. Requires PacketEvents as dependency. <strong>USE IN CRACKED SERVERS, UUIDs ARE NOT SPOOFED BECAUSE IT KICKS OTHER PLAYERS. IF YOU USE ONLINE MODE, PEOPLE CAN RETRIEVE YOUR UUID</strong>

# Confirmed working versions:
- Paper 1.20.2

# Features added:
- The chat formatting with each message being attributed a number, with greentext and everything.
- /name
- /moderate, which allows you to see the list of real usernames or ban a player with a custom duration (in days).
- The spoof of names and ping in TAB and nametags, I haven't found a way to reliably spoof UUIDs without getting others kicked.
- Replacing join, leave, death messages.
- Random chat IDs
- Automatically disable advancement messages
- Blocking tab complete because you can see the actual names with it (you can still be able to see commands and vanilla commands are not affected because the completion is client-side).
