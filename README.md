Brings the idea of being anonymous to Minecraft multiplayer. Requires ProtocolLib as dependency. <strong>USE IN CRACKED SERVERS, UUIDs ARE NOT SPOOFED BECAUSE IT KICKS OTHER PLAYERS. IF YOU USE ONLINE MODE, PEOPLE CAN RETRIEVE YOUR UUID</strong>

# Confirmed working versions :
- Paper 1.18.2
- I believe anything above 1.19.2 would break the spoofing feature.

# Features added:
- The chat formatting with each message being attributed a number, with greentext and everything.
- /name
- The spoof of names and ping in TAB and nametags, I haven't found a way to reliably spoof UUIDs without getting others kicked.
- Replacing join, leave, death messages.
- Random chat IDs

# Not yet added:
- Blocking name tab complete because you can see the actual names with it.
- Something to not show actual name in achievement messages 
- \>\> replies with the message(s) being mentioned when hovering your mouse on it
- and more
